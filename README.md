# Diabetes Prediction Project

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for predicting diabetes using machine learning. It leverages clinical and demographic data to identify individuals at risk of diabetes effectively and efficiently.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that can lead to severe complications, such as cardiovascular issues, kidney failure, and vision loss. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention. Traditional methods are invasive and time-consuming, while machine learning offers a faster and non-invasive alternative.

### Objectives

- Design and implement a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of diabetes.
- Use clinical and demographic data to achieve accurate predictions.
- Analyze the importance of features in the prediction process.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** Imputed using statistical measures or dropped if necessary.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Transformed using one-hot or label encoding.
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardized or normalized for consistent scaling across features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions, relationships, and trends using histograms, density plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- Identified key predictors like glucose levels and BMI.

### 3. Model Development
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.
- Explored various algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search and Randomized Search.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Conducted cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.

### 5. Results
- The best model achieved high accuracy and balanced precision-recall scores.
- Identified significant predictors, such as glucose levels and BMI.
